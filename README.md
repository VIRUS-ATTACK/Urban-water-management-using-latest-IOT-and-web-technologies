# Urban-water-management-using-latest-IOT-and-web-technologies

Focus of this Project is to address the concerns pertaining to urban water crisis, both in terms of quantity and quality, using latest IoT and web technologies

Download the file(Urban-water-management-using-latest-IOT-and-web-technologies-master) and extract it, after extracting go to the 'Urban-water-management-using-latest-IOT-and-web-technologies-master' directory and then open the hackos directory,then open the terminal in the current directory(hackos) and run the command 'python manage.py runserver', it starts a development server at 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/' type this IP address in your local browser and you will go to our website.Please note that the file flow.py(located inside the 'Urban-water-management-using-latest-IOT-and-web-technologies-master' directory)contains the code for collecting data from sensors and sending data to django website(Make sure that you have installed all the libraries i.e mcp 3008 module to read data from ADC,also make sure that you have all the sensors connected to the raspberry pi i.e temperature and humidity sensor DHT11,one soil moisture sensors,two 5V dc motors,one ultrasonic sensor HC SR-04,one water sensor or rain sensor,one turbidity sensor and one waterflow sensor) ,now run the code(flow.py) with url pointing to to the url of the Django website,for example if the url for the website is 'http://virusattack.pythonanywhere.com' then you must change the url in flow.py code to url="http://virusattack.pythonanywhere.com/get/".
